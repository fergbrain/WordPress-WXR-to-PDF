Description:
This program converts a WordPress WXR (WordPress eXtended RSS) file to a PDF document.
It parses the WXR file to extract blog posts and pages, including their content,
authors, publication dates, and comments. The extracted data is then formatted and
written to a PDF file, which includes a title page, a table of contents, and the content
of each post and page. The program can be run from the command line with the WXR file
and output PDF file specified as arguments.

Getting started:

Contents of the wp-content/uploads folder needs to be in ./content
You will need to download DejaVu font and put it in ./fonts: https://dejavu-fonts.github.io/
